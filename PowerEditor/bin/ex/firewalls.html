<H3>Dealing with Firewalls</H3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>Firewalls are everywhere. It seems like everyone's company LAN is
connected to the Internet these days, and nearly all those companies have
prudently put their LAN behind some kind of firewall. So, it's likely
that some day someone will try to use your client or server across their
firewall. Depending on a number of factors, this may work without trouble,
or you may run into many problems trying to make this work. This article
will discuss these problems and some of the solutions to them.</p>



<h4>How Your Protocol Affects Firewalls</h4>

<p>For the greatest chances of working through a firewall without trouble,
you should use a simple single-connection TCP-based protocol: the client
connects to the server, sends data and gets replies on that connection,
and when finished closes the connection.</p>

<p>For an example of a protocol that causes problems with firewalls,
consider FTP. FTP has two connections: a control connection and a data
connection. The control connection is always present, but the data
connection is brought up only when the server needs to send bulk data
to the client, such as a directory listing or the contents of a file.</p>

<p>In traditional "active" mode, the FTP server connects back to the
client to establish the data connection. The problem is, the client
has to tell the server which port number it's listening on for the data
connection. When the client is behind a firewall, the server believes
it's connected to the firewall machine, so it tries to connect to the
given port on the firewall, which isn't listening for the connection. The
server gets rejected, and the client sits waiting forever for the server
to connect to it.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to this problem. The first is for the client
to use "passive" mode: the client connects to the server for the data
connection, instead of the server connecting to the client. The other
solution is for the firewall to know the FTP protocol, so it can recognize
the FTP data connection port number within the protocol, rewrite it to
a port the firewall can use, and then listen on that port.  When the
FTP server connects to the firewall, the firewall can then connect to
the FTP client inside the firewall and begin relaying data.</p>

<p>Unless you're writing a client for a well-known protocol, you should
try to write it so the firewall doesn't have to know your protocol
in order to forward packets. For the longest time, RealAudio clients
didn't work behind firewalls because of the way Real Networks designed
the protocol. Today that isn't a problem, but it took Real years to
achieve the success they needed to get firewall vendors to add support
for their protocol.</p>


<h4>Clients Behind Masquerading Firewalls</h4>

<p>Let's assume that your client uses a simple single-connection TCP-based
protocol. There are still potential problems ahead: the type of firewall
can make a difference to your client.</p>

<p>From a client program's perspective, the simplest kind of firewall
is the masquerading firewall. They appear to hosts inside the firewall
like a simple gateway to the Internet.</p>

<p>A masquerading firewall is fairly tricky from a technical
perspective. Packets destined for the Internet go to the masquerading
firewall, which changes the internal IP address and source port number of
outbound packets to the firewall machine's IP address and a generated port
number. Then they pass the packet outside to the Internet and wait for the
reply. When the reply comes back, the firewall recognizes the port number
it generated, and uses that to translate the port and IP back to the
"internal" values, then passes it on to the host inside the LAN.</p>

<p>If your protocol is simple, your program should work through a
masquerading firewall without problems. The only likely problem you'll
run into is if the firewall blocks outbound connections to all but
a few select ports. In this case, you'll have to ask the firewall's
administrator to open up your port. This is discussed in more detail
below in the "Firewalls, Politics and Paranoia" section.</p>



<h4>Clients Behind SOCKS Firewalls</h4>

<p>If a firewall doesn't do masquerading, it will usually allow clients
to get through it via the <a href="../../rfcs/useful.html#rfc1928">SOCKS
protocol</a>. SOCKS allows a client program on a protected internal
network to ask the firewall to act as a relay between it and a host
outside the firewall.</p>

<p>SOCKS version 4 is the "basic" protocol. The main difference between
masquerading and SOCKS v4 is that masquerading is transparent, whereas
with SOCKS you have to modify your program to make SOCKS requests to
get through the firewall. (SOCKS v4 also has a few features masquerading
doesn't, like basic plaintext authentication, but this is a minor
issue.)</p>

<p>SOCKS version 5 builds on that base and adds UDP support, end-to-end
encryption, and secure logins. These latter two features make it much
more secure than SOCKS v4 and masquerading, so it's becoming quite
common. Few firewalls require encryption to get through, but quite a
few are requiring SOCKS v5 logins, to curtail rogue programs getting
through the firewall.</p>

<p>You can find out more about SOCKS via the following links:</p>

	This looks like a good introduction to the SOCKS protocol.
</ul>

<p>NEC's SOCKSCap allows almost any Winsock program to run over a SOCKS
firewall with no changes to the application. (There are other vendors
that offer SOCKSifiers, and a few non-Microsoft Winsock stacks are
SOCKSified.) The problem with SOCKSCap is that your users must set up
SOCKSCap by hand, and they must run your program <i>through</i> the
SOCKSifier. It's more user-friendly to implement the SOCKS protocol
within your program.</p>

<p>SOCKS does let you get around some of the limitations imposed by a
masquerading firewall. For one thing, you can do a "remote bind": ask
the firewall to listen on a port for you, and pass connections in to
your program. SOCKS v5's UDP support may also prove helpful to you. Just
beware that even SOCKS firewalls can limit your design choices.</p>



<h4>Firewalls, Politics and Paranoia</h4>

<p>Technical people often look at a firewall as a technical solution
to a technical problem. In fact, a firewall is a political construct.
Like a country's border, it exists to protect an organization's turf
from invaders. The permeability of a network firewall depends on the
paranoia level of the people who control the firewall: there's a lot to
be paranoid about in today's Internet.</p>

<p>Many firewalls are set up to block all outbound connections except
to a very few ports. For example, the firewall might be set up to
allow outbound connections on ports 80, 21 and 25 only (web, FTP and
outbound email). If your application uses a port that the firewall blocks,
you will have to persuade the network administrators to open up that
port on <i>their</i> firewall. Network admins are often very territorial
about their firewalls. Getting your way will require a certain amount
of political finesse.</p>

<p>The administrators at such a site have decided that they'd rather
open ports on a case-by-case basis than block ports as new security risks
get discovered. You have to convince the admins to open up your port. I
suggest that you prepare a written argument explaining what your program
does, why it does it, and an analysis of potential risks. Don't fudge
on the argument: be completely honest and open. Present the benefits of
the application separately; you're not trying to convince the admins to
use the program, just to show that the application is useful to users on
their network. Try to get some of those users to speak with the network
admins directly to help you press your case.</p>

<p>Why a written argument? Partly because it shows professionalism,
partly because you might not be able to speak with the admins directly,
and partly because it forces you to clarify and organize your thoughts.
If you just call the admin up on the phone and make up your arguments as
you speak with him, you may just come across as <i>argumentative</i>.
Even if you do end up speaking with the administrator directly, having
a written argument to refer to will help you to make your case.</p>

<p>Some people suggest a different tactic: change your program so that it
sends its packets out on a port that's open on even the most restrictive
firewalls. Because some firewalls examine the contents of packets to
make sure they're legitimate, some people even suggest encapsulating
your data in the protocol that usually runs on that port. For example,
you could send your data out on port 80, and put your program data in
the payload area of HTTP packets.</p>

<p>To extend the "politics" analogy, this is the "smuggling" tactic. Just
like smuggling in the real world, it's likely to get you into trouble. You
won't go to jail for it, but you might generate a lot of antagonism
toward your program; network admins have been known to band together
and ban programs that annoy them.</p>



<h4>Servers Behind Firewalls</h4>

<p>Let's say you've written a server program. It works fine, but then
someone tries to use it behind a firewall, while the clients are on the
other side of the firewall. This is very common when the server is
running on someone's LAN, but they want to access your server from out
on the wider Internet.</p>

<p>The easiest solution is simply to move the server outside the firewall,
but most network administrators are extremely reluctant to do this. Common
reasons are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Most of the users are inside the firewall: the users outside are
	the exception, not the rule.<img src="../bitmaps/dot-clear.gif" alt="" width=1 height=30 align=top> <br clear=all>

	<li>The firewall setup doesn't allow anything outside the
	firewall.<img src="../bitmaps/dot-clear.gif" alt="" width=1 height=30 align=top> <br clear=all>

	<li>The firewall is administered by some other party, like the
	company's ISP, and they won't allow you to put your server outside
	their firewall.<img src="../bitmaps/dot-clear.gif" alt="" width=1 height=30 align=top> <br clear=all>

	<li>If you can put the server behind the firewall, the firewall can
	control access to the server: it's an extra layer of protection
	between your server and the big bad Internet.<img src="../bitmaps/dot-clear.gif" alt="" width=1 height=30 align=top> <br clear=all>

	<li>It's axiomatic that you should not expose any more services
	to the outside world than you have to. Some network admins will
	stubbornly fall back on this despite any arguments you can muster,
	no matter how logical.<img src="../bitmaps/dot-clear.gif" alt="" width=1 height=30 align=top> <br clear=all>
</ol>

<p>If you run into this, the solution is to get the firewall administrator
to set up "network address translation". NAT is a term for several
vaguely-related techniques, two of which you can use to make your server
visible outside the firewall: port forwarding and address forwarding.</p>

<p>To understand NAT, consider the following LAN setup: the internal
LAN hosts use the private IP address block 10.x.x.x. Let's say the host
your server is running on has the internal IP address 10.1.2.3. Their
ISP has assigned this company the public IP subnet 123.4.5.{1-15}. The
firewall has at least two addresses: let's say 123.4.5.1 on the outside,
and 10.1.1.1 on the inside.</p>

<p>Address forwarding is the simplest, but also the riskier of the two
approaches. To set up address forwarding for our example LAN, the firewall
could assign 123.4.5.2 to your server. Whenever requests come in on that
address, it quietly translates the destination address to 10.1.2.3 and
the source address to 10.1.1.1, and then it passes the packet inside
the LAN for your server to handle. When your server replies, it believes
it is replying to the firewall at 10.1.1.1. The firewall gets the reply
packet and translates the source address to 123.4.5.2 and the destination
address to that of the host that made the initial request. Then it sends
the packet out onto the Internet which routes the reply back to the
client.</p>

<p>The problem with address translation is that if your server host has
any security holes, the firewall will let anyone outside break in through
those holes. Once they're inside your server, they're also effectively
inside the LAN, so the firewall's protection is totally gone.</p>

<p>The more secure NAT technology is port translation. Let's say your
server uses port 1234. When you set up port translation on the firewall,
it begins listening for packets on that port, which it forwards inside
the firewall to your server. This is more secure because it only exposes
that one port to the outside world.</p>

<p>Sometimes address and port translation are combined. Let's say the
firewall only has one outside IP address available to it, and that
you have several servers inside the LAN that use the same port. The
firewall's NAT features may allow it to listen on ports 2000 through 2007
and translate packets coming in to each of those ports to different hosts
inside the LAN, each with the same port, like your server's 1234.</p>

<p>Not all of these options are available on all firewalls, and the
network adminstrator might not know how to use these features even if
they are present. Or, they may simply be unwilling to let your server be
visible from outside the firewall. Just like with the political issues
with clients discussed above, resist the temptation to piggyback your
protocol on top of an "approved" port and protocol, unless the firewall
administrator gives you permission.</p>

firewalls or other problems getting through firewalls, please <a
